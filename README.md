# Log Data Renderer

Convert incoming data into logging data by creating its stringified representation.
Currently its used in [DOMConsole](https://github.com/burdiuz/js-dom-console) and [React Native Console](https://github.com/burdiuz/react-native-console) as a data layer.  
  
It can be extended by adding types that need specific conversion, for more information look into source code, `/source/types`.

```
npm install @actualwave/log-data-renderer

```
yarn add @actualwave/log-data-renderer
```
